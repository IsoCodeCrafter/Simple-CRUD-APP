**Create (Add)**: To add a new item, you first create a form structure where users can input the details of the item they want to add. This form structure allows users to input information, such as the title, author, or other relevant details about a book.

**Read (Read)**: After the form structure is created, the application needs to read the information entered by the user in the input fields. This information is usually gathered and stored in variables for further use.

**Update (Update)**: To update an existing item, you need to create an object that holds various attributes of the item. For example, an object may contain an "id," a "date," a "read status," and the "name" of the book entered through the input fields.

Delete (Delete)**: When a user clicks the "Add" button, the object created in step 3 should be added to an array, where all the items are stored. Additionally, the input fields should be cleared after adding the item to the array.

**Display (List)**: The application should have a state (e.g., `bookList`) where it keeps all the books or items in an array. This list can be mapped to create a user-friendly display. Each item in the array can be shown on the screen using a card or a similar UI element. Users can see a list of all the added items.
**Delete (Delete)**: Each item in the displayed list, such as the "book card," should have a "Delete" button. When a user clicks the "Delete" button associated with an item, it should be removed from the array, effectively deleting it.

**This process describes the basic functionality of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, often used for managing items in a collection or database. Users can add, view, update, and delete items within the application.
